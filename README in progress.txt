Project Name:
Will Marney - Eastroad Band Website - Milestone Project. 

This project is to promote a band that I worked with for a number of years. It is designed to encourage people to discover more about the band by being able to watch a music video, see photos and learn who they are and what they do. 

It is also designed to encourage people to follow the band on Social Media Sites and other platforms as well as book tickets to future shows.

UX:
This website is for anyone looking to learn more about this band. Most visitors will know who the band are already but some will not and be potential bookers, management companies, PR Agencies and Labels looking to discover more about the band and it's online presence. 
I have designed a One Page Scroller website rather than multiple pages as the amount of text information is limited and we are focusing on a more image based engagement. 

The project WireFrame is included in the file tree and can be referenced for design purpose. The Overall design has changed slightly from the initial idea, but the core idea remains the same. 
We want to provide an easy reading experience with plenty of engaging visuals in order to encourgage the viewer to follow on Social Media, and come to more live shows. 

Features:
Navigation Bar:
Allows our users to go directly to a point of the website if they wish to for quick navigation of the site.

Video:
Embeded YouTube of the latest Music Video, allows viewers to see something engaging immediately and potentially follow/subscribe on YouTube. This will also boost viewing numbers on the YouTube Page. 

Bio/About Us:
A short bio of the band and what they have done in the past as well as what they will be doing in the future. 

Tour Dates:
A table that will allow users to see the upcoming dates and locations for shows on the tour and then purchase tickets for shows via the link button to TicketMaster provided. 

Gallery: 
A photo gallery of the band in action. A number of engaging photos to be used that will engage viewers further. If clicked upon they will open the full size image in a new window.

Contact Us:
A contact form that will allow people to contact the band directly by filling out their details. This will be potential bookers, labels and PR Companies as well as FanMail. 

Footer:
A basic footer that will include the band management details an email address for contacting as well as all of the Social Media Links. 

Technologies Used:
Languages used to create this site include HTML5 and CSS3. I have also used Bootstrap, Google Fonts and FontAwesome to help with the site build. 

Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/ - used to create the fluid containers for various viewing devices.
Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/ - used to choose the various fonts used within the website.
Font Awesome: https://fontawesome.com/ - used in the footer for the social media icon links. 

Testing: 
I have tested the site thouroughly, and viewed it on various devices to ensure that it works correctly accross a variety of devices. Some of the code was written in a seperate GitPod Workspace entitled DIV Testing, this was due to the fact that in a early iterations of the site I was not using BootStrap effectively, but rather than removing previous code I decided to create a testing area where code could tested and modified before being deployed into the main GitPod project. 

The link to the testing area is supplied below.

Deployment:

The process was deployed via the terminals in GitPod, using commits and pushes. As a testing workspace was used all commits and pushes on the main project are considered the developed and final version. 
All future testing will be tested on the Testing Workspace before being deployed to the main workspace.

Acknowledgements:
I received inspiration for this project from the Code Institute Website Suggestions for the First Milestone Project.
I used to play in this band, and had despite using various social media pages a website was always discussed but never really felt to be a priority. I decided to use the knowledge I have gained recently to make the band a website.
